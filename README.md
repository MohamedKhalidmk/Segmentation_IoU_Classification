# Segmentation_IoU_Classification
This project aims to automate the classification of plant leaves using image processing and machine learning techniques. The pipeline involves loading leaf images, segmenting the leaf from the background using morphological operations, extracting geometric features, and training a Random Forest classifier to predict the plant species.
